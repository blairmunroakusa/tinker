Welcome to my general tinker space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. This is where I accumulate miscellaneous little projects
. These may be related to coding, or not.
. As something matures, I may migrate it somewhere more structured.
. There is a DUMP here for processing.
. There are some working logs and miscellany
. An idea will live in it's own directory,
	until it matures into its own repo, or not.
